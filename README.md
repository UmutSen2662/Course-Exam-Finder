# Course Exam Finder

Course Exam Finder is a python gui app made with ttk and [Azure](Azure/). To use it you need to have CEF and the midterm.csv file in the same directory after that you just enter all your courses and the csv filename and it will create an organised excel file with all your exems.

## Installation

To install you can either clone this repo and access the Course Exam Finder.exe or you can click dowload as zip in the green code button and extact to do the same thing or you can go and dowload it from the releases tab.

## Roadmap

This is feature rich enough for me but I am open to suggestions also it sometimes bugs out as well and I havent been able to figure ot why so if you see the bug please write about it as well.
